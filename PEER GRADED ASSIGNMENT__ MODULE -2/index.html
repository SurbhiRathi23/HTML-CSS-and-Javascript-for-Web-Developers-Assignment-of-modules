                <p>
                	
This scrumptious version of pizza, which literally translates into "meat with dough," is brought to you by the Lebanese (other parts of the Middle East call it by other names) and is made with minced onions, usually ground lamb, cumin and yogurt. If you have never tried it, you really must! Soo delicious.

                <h2>Neapolitan-pizza</h2>
                <p>
                	
The Neapolitan hails from Naples and is the basis for our modern-day American pizza, a favorite of Michelangelo of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (though we're sure the artist Michelangelo would have liked it, too). Originally, the Neapolitan pie was served sans cheese. That's how the plain pizza morphed into the Margherita.

                <h2>Margherita</h2>
                <p>
                  
The pizza Margherita is just over a century old and is named after HM Queen Margherita of Italy, wife of King Umberto I and first Queen of Italy. It's made using toppings of tomato, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, which represent the red, white, and green of the Italian flag.
